## App idea
The app's idea is to help you pick food for female.

## Usage instructions
The usage of the app is kind of self-explanatory if you understand Finnish.
If you do not speak Finnish, use a translation service.

Main features include:
  - Creating a user
  - Changing user password
  - Deleting a user
  - Seeing globally picked foods
  - Seeing own picked foods
