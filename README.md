## App idea
The app's idea is to help you pick food for female. I mainly focus on the mobile experience. The app works on larger screens as well, but for the best experience, try it on mobile or the PWA.

## Usage instructions
The usage of the app is kind of self-explanatory if you understand Finnish.
If you do not speak Finnish, use a translation service.

Main features include:
  - Creating a user
  - Changing user password
  - Deleting a user
  - Seeing globally picked foods
  - Seeing own picked foods

Remember to try the PWA version! 
Use your phone's Chrome browser. Then, from the settings, select "Install."
In the images, my UI is in Finnish, but the icons remain the same.
